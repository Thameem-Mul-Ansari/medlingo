Despite the loss of activity of most neutralizing mAbs, a 
few have been reported recently that retain potency 
against Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, BA.1, BA.2, and 
BA.4/5 variants, and in some cases BA.1.1 or BA.2.12.1. 
Based on their footprints on the RBD, these mAbs can 
be roughly divided into two groups: those targeting the 
back of the left-shoulder (F61 [27] and Omi-42 [28]) and 
right-shoulder binders (LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab)  
[29], 2–7 [30], XGv265 [31], XG005 [32], AZD1061 [1], 
MB.02 [33], SP1–77 [34], and 002-S21F2) [35]. However, 
it is likely that many of these mAbs will lose potency 
against the most recently emerging Omicron sublineages 
(BA.2.3.20, BA.2.75, BA.4.6, BA.5, BJ.1, BQ.1, and XBB) 
with one or several of five mutations: R346X, K444X, 
V445X, N450D, and N460X. Specifically, MAbs men -
