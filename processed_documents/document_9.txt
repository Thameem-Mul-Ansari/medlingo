[16â€“18] . Here, we mainly review broadly neutralizing 
mAbs directed against highly conserved epitopes in 
portions of the RBD and SD1 on S1 and the stem-helix 
region and the fusion peptide in S2 ( Figure 1 b). 
Receptor-binding domain 
MAbs binding near the neck and shoulders of the RBD 
have either footprint or spatial overlap with ACE2, en -
abling them to block ACE2 binding and thus have the 
strongest neutralizing abilities against SARS-CoV-2. 
Mabs with epitopes far from this area, lower on the 
flanks of the RBD, for example, EY6A [19] , S304  
[20] , and S309 [21] , are usually much less potent. 
The succession of mutations from earlier-circulating 
variants of concern (VoCs) B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 
(Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) to B.1.1.529 
(Omicron BA.1) and the currently worldwide-dominant 
Omicron strains (with respective prevalence: BQ.1
