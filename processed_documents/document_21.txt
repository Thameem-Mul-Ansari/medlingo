may use the same neutralization mechanism since it 
recognizes a similar epitope to S2H97. S309 (sotrovimab) 
is another therapeutic antibody, which binds the right 
flank. S309 was an effective therapeutic broadly neu -
tralizing antibody against earlier variants, but its potency 
was impaired by BA.2 sublineage, possibly due to the 
S371F mutation [40], so it is no longer in widespread 
therapeutic use. 
Examples of broadly neutralizing antibodies that target 
the conserved region at the back of the RBD are S304, 
IY-2A [38], and EY6A (Figure 3c). They all recognize a 
cryptic epitope buried inside the RBD-down trimeric 
spike and neutralize SARS-COV-2 Wuhan strain by 
disrupting the spike trimer [19,20,38]. This epitope is 
conserved across all established and emerging variants. 
S304, IY-2A, and EY6A all retain their strong binding 
affinity for Omicron BA.1 RBD, however, S304 com -
pletely lost its neutralizing ability against Omicron
