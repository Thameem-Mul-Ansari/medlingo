site (Figures 2d and 3c). Representative neutralizing 
mAbs binding in the vicinity of the left-flank conserved 
region include COVOX-45 [6] and S2H97 [37]. S2H97 
binds RBD exactly at the left flank, while COVOX-45 
binds somewhat more toward the front (Figure 3a, b). It 
was reported that S2H97 protected hamsters infected by 
SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and could neutralize BA.1 
variant. S2H97 binds a panel of 45 RBDs of SARS-re -
lated coronaviruses (sarbecoviruses) with high affinity 
and is a promising pan-sarbecovirus-neutralizing anti -
body [37,39]. COVOX-45 recognizes a similar epitope to 
S2H97 but the breadth of its potency has not been 
checked. S2H97 induces receptor-independent conver -
sion of spike protein to the post-fusion state, thereby 
inhibiting ACE2-dependent cell entry [37]. COVOX-45 
may use the same neutralization mechanism since it 
recognizes a similar epitope to S2H97. S309 (sotrovimab) 
is another therapeutic antibody, which binds the right
