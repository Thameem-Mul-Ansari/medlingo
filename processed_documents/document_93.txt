One important limitation was that this study had only self-reported information from the RHINE
standardised questionnaire and no objective clinical measures. The asthma diagnosis was not validated
against medical records, and we also lacked information on asthma medication. This might lead to some
degree of misclassification in the assessment of asthma. Furthermore, the cross-sectional analysis did not
allow us to make any causal inference. Another weakness is that we did not have information on severe
infections leading to hospitalisation. We also lacked drug prescriptions data and could not study whether
asthma medication such as inhaled corticosteroids modified the risk of infection. However, it is the
subjective symptoms that affect the individualâ€™s life and work status, and therefore the subjective outcome
is more relevant for public health [58].
Conclusion
In this study, we identified several factors that may be considered to increase the risk of respiratory tract
