changes were demonstrated by structures of prefusion 
spike–Fab complexes [50–52]. In contrast, CV3–25 
binds to the hydrophilic face of the helix, however, the 
CV3–25-bound stem helix (seen in a crystal structure) 
adopts a different conformation to that in the native 
prefusion spike visualized by cryo-EM structure [17]. All 
these antibodies were broadly neutralized in pseudo -
virus neutralization assay or animal models, but their 
potency was weak [17,50–53]. 
Fusion peptide 
The fusion peptide is a hydrophobic segment of ∼20 
residues, in the S2 domain of the spike protein, which is 
immediately downstream of the S2′ cleavage site and 
responsible for initiation of the fusion of the virus and 
host cell membranes (residues 816–837, Figure 1b). This 
peptide is highly conserved across all SARS-CoV-2 var -
iants. Sequence alignment of more than 7.9 million de -
posited SARS-CoV-2 sequences indicates residues in this 
region have identities >  99.7% [54]. Indeed, this peptide
