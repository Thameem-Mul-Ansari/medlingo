There are several reasons why participants with asthma report more respiratory infections and higher use of
antibiotics than those without asthma. Several studies have shown that asthma is associated with a
dysregulation of the immune response and impaired production of antiviral interferons [38]. Participants
with asthma are also more likely to have severe respiratory symptoms during an infection, which may
increase the likelihood of getting antibiotics prescribed. It is also possible that persons with asthma are

In the present study, 33% of participants with asthma had used antibiotics because of respiratory infection
within the last year. The increased prevalence of use of antibiotics for respiratory infection in asthma in
our study is in accordance with a previous study based on an antibiotic register that reported a more
