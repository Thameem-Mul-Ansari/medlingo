membrane fusion with the host cell. The S1 subunit has 
a string of domains with the N-terminal domain (NTD), 
subdomain 1 (SD1), and receptor-binding domain 
(RBD) all characterized as binding neutralizing anti -
bodies ( Figure 1 b). The RBD harbors the ACE2-binding 
site, which lies across the top of the RBD, spanning the 
neck and shoulders ( Figure 1 c). The RBD adopts a 
range of configurations on the spike, from ‘up’ to ‘down’, 
and only the up conformation can interact with ACE2  
[8] . Both up and down conformations are observed in 
published spike structures [6,8–10] . Previously, we in -
troduced a naming convention for the RBD to describe 
the epitopes of RBD-specific neutralizing mAbs, which 
can be grouped in several clusters: left shoulder, neck, 
right shoulder, left flank, and right flank [6] ( Figure 1 c). 
Most potent neutralizing mAbs induced by vaccination 
or natural infection target the RBD and usually interfere
