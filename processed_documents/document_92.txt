HMW and respiratory tract infections in the asthmatic population. No significant association between
occupational exposure divided into agents with different molecular weights and respiratory tract infections
or use of antibiotics was found in the previous studies. Other studies have, however, found that certain
kinds of occupational exposures increase the risk of pneumonia [57].
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths and limitations. A key strength was that we used a very large population of
randomly selected subjects from different research centres in five Nordic countries. Also, the subjects
answered detailed questionnaires that enable robust analyses with several important confounders.
One important limitation was that this study had only self-reported information from the RHINE
standardised questionnaire and no objective clinical measures. The asthma diagnosis was not validated
