induced by binding of ACE2. Once again, compared with 
anti-RBD antibodies, these antibodies have weak po -
tency against SARS-CoV-2 [18,54,56]. 
Conclusion 
The rapid evolution of antibody-binding epitopes enables 
viruses to escape host immune response. The BA.1 strain 
identified in November 2021 showed widespread escape 
from antibody responses to vaccination or infection by early 
pandemic virus [23] and in turn antibody responses from 
BA.1 infection led to responses with significantly poorer 
neutralization of BA.4/5, compared with BA.1 and BA.2 [4]. 
Indeed, the majority of potent anti-RBD mAbs were 
knocked out by BA.4/5. Since BA.4/5 SARS-COV-2 has 
continued to evolve to gain increased immune escape, 
leading to the proliferation of a large number of variants, 
often arriving, via convergent evolution of common amino 
acid substitutions at positions around the ACE2 footprint 
that abrogate the binding of groups of antibodies. Thus,
