Statistics
The categorical variables were presented as prevalence with percentage, and the continuous variables were
presented as mean with standard deviation (SD). Multiple logistic regression models with and without
adjustment for selected confounding factors such as age, sex, smoking status, BMI and centre were used to

the regression analysis were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. All statistical analysis
was performed with R program version 4.0.2, applying a 5% level of significance.
