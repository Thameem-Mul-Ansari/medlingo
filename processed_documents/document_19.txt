combined with cilgavimab as AZD5156 that is in Phase- 
I/-III clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ 
NCT05648110) for pre-exposure prophylaxis of im -
munocompromised patients. 
In addition to the highly potent mAbs, there are also 
more weakly neutralizing anti-RBD mAbs with potential 
broad neutralizing ability [6,19,37,38]. These weakly 
neutralizing mAbs have little or no effect on ACE2 
binding but they bind RBD in two different conserved 
regions and utilize different neutralization mechanisms. 
These two large continuous conserved regions on the 
RBD surface are: one starts from the front of the left 
shoulder and runs all the way down to the left flank 
(Figures 2e and 3a, b); another one is at the bottom part 
of the back of the RBD, just below the Omi-42-binding 
site (Figures 2d and 3c). Representative neutralizing 
mAbs binding in the vicinity of the left-flank conserved 
region include COVOX-45 [6] and S2H97 [37]. S2H97
