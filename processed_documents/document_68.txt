centres. In the general population, early life infection increased the presence of respiratory infection in
adulthood in particularly in Gothenburg, Uppsala and Aarhus (supplementary table 4A), whereas the highest
use of antibiotics in adults was seen in subjects that reported early life infection in Aarhus and Bergen
(supplementary table 4B).
Occupational and environmental exposure in the general population and in asthmatic individuals
In the general population, exposure to dampness and mould was associated with more frequent respiratory
tract infections and the use of antibiotics, whereas no associations were found for occupational exposure to
LMW, HMW or irritants (figure 3, supplementary Table 2). Asthmatic individuals exposed to dampness
and mould had a higher odds of respiratory tract infections. There was a borderline significant association
between exposure to HMW (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.98â€“2.54) and respiratory tract infections and
