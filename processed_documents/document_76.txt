Estonia than in Sweden and Iceland [40]. Another study on infections in children reported that the use of
antibiotics was two times higher in Estonian children compared to Swedish children [41]. The higher
prevalence of infections in children might be explained by the hygiene hypothesis, which suggested that a
low exposure to microbes in early life disables the maturation of the immunological system [42]. The
geographical difference in reported infections and antibiotics could also be explained by the combination
of different factors such as genetic susceptibility, geographic variations in resistance level and difference in
adherence to guidelines [42, 43].
In this study, women report respiratory tract infections and antibiotic use more often than men. Our results
are in line with a previous study where significantly more females than males (both asthmatic and
non-asthmatic subjects) were prescribed antibiotics in both France and Italy [12]. On the contrary, females
