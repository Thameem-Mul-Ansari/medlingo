of the RBD usually neutralize more weakly, possibly 
because they have no or little blocking effect on ACE2 
binding. 
N-terminal domain 
Although there are also neutralizing antibodies that re -
cognize the NTD, this spike domain is less im -
munogenic than the RBD, possibly due to its extensive 
glycan shielding [20,43,44] . Neutralizing mAbs targeting 
the NTD appear to mainly recognize an extended single

(a–c) Binding of the CDRs of COVOX-45, S2H97, and EY6A with the more conserved regions of the RBD (COVOX-45, PDB: 7PRY; S2H97, 
PDB: 7M7W; EY6A, PDB: 6ZCZ). (d and e) Different binding patterns of P008_60 (blue, PDB: 7ZBU), S3H3 (red, PDB: 7WD8), and SD1.040 (green, 
PDB: 8D48) with the SD1 (gray). The mutations T547K and A570D of the SD1 are labeled. The peptide 320–330 of the RBD that interacts with S3H3 is 
shown as an orange cartoon.
