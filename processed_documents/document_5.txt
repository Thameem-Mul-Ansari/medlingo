Omicron strains ( Figure 1 a, phylogenetic tree), the virus 
has gained increased transmissibility and immune es -
cape. Many mAbs, including approved therapeutic ones 
that neutralize earlier variants, have largely or totally lost 
their ability to neutralize new variants [3,4] . It is there -
fore essential to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies 
for the ongoing Omicron variants and, ideally, new var -
iants that will emerge in the future. 
The major antigens of SARS-CoV-2 are the nucleopro -
tein and the trimeric spike glycoprotein, and numerous 
spike-binding antibodies have been characterized as 
potent neutralizers [5,6] . Spike consists of the S1 and S2 
subunits that are linked by a furin protease cleavage site. 
S1 mediates binding with the receptor angiotensin- 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] and S2 facilitates 
membrane fusion with the host cell. The S1 subunit has 
a string of domains with the N-terminal domain (NTD), 
subdomain 1 (SD1), and receptor-binding domain
