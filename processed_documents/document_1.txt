The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to 
hundreds of millions of infections and millions of deaths, 
however, human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be an 
effective treatment. Since SARS-CoV-2 emerged, a variety of 
strains have acquired increasing numbers of mutations to gain 
increased transmissibility and escape from the immune 
response. Most reported neutralizing human mAbs, including all 
approved therapeutic ones, have been knocked down or out by 
these mutations. Broadly neutralizing mAbs are therefore of 
great value, to treat current and possible future variants. Here, 
we review four types of neutralizing mAbs against the spike 
protein with broad potency against previously and currently 
circulating variants. These mAbs target the receptor-binding
