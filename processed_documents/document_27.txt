so they generally cannot be recognized by neutralizing 
mAbs [8] . Representative neutralizing mAbs targeting 
SD1 include S3H3 [16] , P008_60 [46] , and sd1.040 [47] . 
Pseudovirus or live-virus neutralization assays showed 
that these antibodies neutralize a panel of variants but 
recognize different epitopes [16,46,47] . While all interact 
with SD1, S3H3 also interacts with the N-terminal re -
gion and sd1.040 interacts with the C-terminal region of 
the RBD ( Figure 3 d, e). S3H3 binds trimeric spike but 
P008_60 and sd1.040 dissociate trimeric spike and only 
complexes of S1 with Fab could be observed, due to 
clashes of Fabs with the adjacent NTD in the trimeric 
spike. Given the ability of P008_60 and sd1.040 to 
neutralize the virus, they may recognize an un -
characterized rare conformational state of the spike in 
which its epitope on SD1 is accessible. P008â€“60 and 
sd1.040 therefore neutralize the virus by destabilizing
