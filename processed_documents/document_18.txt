Omi-42 is a highly potent antibody isolated from a pa -
tient infected by BA.1. A cryo-EM structure (PDB: 
7ZR7) shows Omi-42 to bind at the back of the left 
shoulder [11] (Figure 2g, h). Omi-42 and ACE2 have 
substantially overlapping binding footprints on the RBD 
(Figure 2g), so mutations in the overlap region that 
compromise ACE2 binding would not be allowed. The 
mutations that are on the edge of the ACE-binding site 
and may affect binding of Omi-42 are K417N, S477N, 
Q493R, and Y505H. Structural analysis [11] proves that 
these four amino acid residues all interact with Omi-42 
but Omi-42 retains its potency both in a live-virus 
neutralization assay in vitro and a hamster challenge 
study, despite the mutations at these sites [36]. A 
slightly modified version of Omi-42, AZD3152, has been 
combined with cilgavimab as AZD5156 that is in Phase- 
I/-III clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ 
NCT05648110) for pre-exposure prophylaxis of im -
