iants. Sequence alignment of more than 7.9 million de -
posited SARS-CoV-2 sequences indicates residues in this 
region have identities >  99.7% [54]. Indeed, this peptide 
is conserved among all coronaviruses [55]. Several neu -
tralizing mAbs target this region, including COV44–62, 
COV44–79 [18], VN01H1, C77G12 [54], and 76E1 [56] 
(Figure 4b). These mAbs broadly neutralize all alpha- and 
betacoronaviruses, including the currently dominant 
SARS-CoV-2 variants. Experiments on Syrian hamster or 
mouse models showed they all limited disease caused and 
reduced viral load [18,54,56]. Structural studies showed 
the epitope recognized by all these antibodies is in -
accessible in the prefusion spike trimer and it appears the 
epitope becomes exposed upon conformational changes 
induced by binding of ACE2. Once again, compared with 
anti-RBD antibodies, these antibodies have weak po -
tency against SARS-CoV-2 [18,54,56].
