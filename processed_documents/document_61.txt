Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) by an experienced occupational hygienist (ADH) [36]. These
codes were connected to an asthma Job Exposure Matrix ( JEM) based on exposure patterns from the
Nordic counties [32]. JEM classifications included high molecular weight agents (HMW), low molecular
weight agents (LMW) and irritating agents [31]. In addition, we included self-reported exposure to
dampness and mould defined as visible water damage, visible mould or smell of mould in the last
12 months [37].
