(a and b) ACE2 footprint on the RBD. The RBD is colored in light gray and the ACE2 footprint in dark gray. (câ€“e) Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants in 
the RBD. Mutations from strain BQ.1 are colored in red and mutations from other strains that are not present in BQ.1 are colored in yellow. The ACE2 
footprint is marked by black lines. (f) Different binding modes of four mAbs (LY-CoV555: blue, PDB: 7KMG; COVOX-384: red, PDB: 7BEP; 
REGN10987: magenta, PDB: 6XDG; Beta-27: yellow, PDB: 8BH5) with the RBD. (g) Binding region of Omi-42 (red) on the RBD, which is partially 
overlapped with the ACE2 footprint (marked by black lines). (h) Binding of the CDRs of Omi-42 with the RBD (CDRs of the heavy chain are colored in 
cyan and light chain in green), PDB: 7ZR7.
