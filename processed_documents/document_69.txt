between exposure to HMW (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.98–2.54) and respiratory tract infections and
exposure to dampness and use of antibiotics (adjusted OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.97–1.93) in the asthmatic
population (figure 3, supplementary Table 2).
Discussion
The main findings of this study are that asthmatic subjects reported three times higher odds for respiratory
tract infections and more than three times higher odds for subsequent antibiotics than subjects without
asthma. Female sex, obesity and exposure to building dampness were independently associated with
respiratory tract infections, and female sex, current smoking and living in Tartu increased the probability of
antibiotic use both in the general and in the asthmatic population.
