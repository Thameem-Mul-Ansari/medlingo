active smoking and passive smoking had an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections [45, 46].
It was also shown that nonsmokers and ex-smokers were more vulnerable to tobacco smoke than active
smokers that were more adapted [13]. In a previous analysis of part of this population, we also found that
smoking increased the likelihood of having been hospitalised for pneumonia [47].
We also showed that having allergic rhinitis increased the odds of respiratory tract infections and antibiotic
use. There are several potential causal relationships between atopic conditions and microbial infections:
protective (hygiene hypothesis), provocative (rhinovirus or bacterial colonisation), microbiome hypothesis
and reverse causality (the risk for infection in atopic conditions). Previous studies indicate that asthma
exacerbation caused by virus infection may be more severe in patients with coexisting allergies [48, 49].
