(a) Phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 previous VoCs (Wuhan, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1) and currently dominant strains (BA.5, 
BQ.1, BA.2.75, and XBB). The tree is based on the amino acid sequences of the spike protein. (b) Regions of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (in gray, PDB: 
6XR8) targeted by 4 types of broadly neutralizing mAbs. The RBD, NTD, SD1, fusion peptide, and stem helix are colored in blue, cyan, green, red, and 
orange, respectively. (c) Cartoon representation of the RBD (left) and the surface representation of the RBD showing the locations of the left shoulder, 
neck, right shoulder, left flank, and right flank (right), PDB: 7BEI. The binding site of ACE2 on the RBD is colored in green.
