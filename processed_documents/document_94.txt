is more relevant for public health [58].
Conclusion
In this study, we identified several factors that may be considered to increase the risk of respiratory tract
infections and the use of antibiotics in the general and the asthmatic population. Asthmatic individuals
were at particular risk of respiratory tract infections and the use of antibiotics because of respiratory tract
infections. Moreover, living in damp housing significantly increased the risk of respiratory tract infections
and antibiotics compared to non-exposed in both the asthmatic and the general population. From a public
health perspective, it might be important to consider strategies to reduce the rate of respiratory infections
among asthmatic individuals and to pay specific attention to the overuse of antibiotics among asthma
patients.
