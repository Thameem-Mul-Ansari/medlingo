is notable that the associations with the use of antibiotics were more pronounced than the associations with
respiratory tract infections; among asthmatic participants who had been hospitalised for respiratory
infection in childhood, reported use of antibiotics was doubled while reported respiratory tract infections
increased only insignificantly. A previous analysis on subjects from 22 counties found that adults reporting
severe childhood respiratory infections had increased risk for asthma and wheeze as well as lower lung
function in adulthood. Lower lung function was also shown in adults without asthma and wheeze who had
severe respiratory childhood infection [53].
