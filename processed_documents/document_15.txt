of the RBD, was knocked out by the N440K and G446S 
substitutions of the Omicron BA.1 strain [23]. Beta-27, a 
potent mAb that binds at the neck and back of the left 
shoulder and broadly neutralizes Alpha, Beta, Gamma, 
and Delta variants, was impaired by Q493R and Y505H 
of Omicron BA.1 [23] (Figure 2f). In fact, the BA.1 strain 
marked a step change in divergence with no less than 15 
substitutions in the RBD, causing widespread escape 
from most existing, early pandemic generated, neu -
tralizing antibodies [4,23,24]. BA.2 took over from BA.1 
in March 2022 as the dominant variant and globally the 
virus has since fragmented into a plethora of strains 
derived from BA.2, many showing convergent mutations 
around the ACE2-binding site that confer considerable 
escape from responses against earlier versions of Omi -

Despite the loss of activity of most neutralizing mAbs, a 
few have been reported recently that retain potency
