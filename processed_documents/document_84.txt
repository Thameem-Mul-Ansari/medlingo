that both obesity and underweight increases the risk of hospitalisations for pneumonia [47]. In the present
study, we found that having diabetes (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.03â€“2.04) increased the likelihood of using
antibiotics because of associations with respiratory tract infections. This is in accordance with previous
studies [50]. We also found that cardiovascular conditions were associated with more reported respiratory
tract infections and the use of antibiotics. Previous studies showed that cardiovascular disease was
associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract infections [51, 52].
We found that childhood hospitalisation for respiratory infections before age 2 years and frequent otitis
were associated with higher odds for respiratory tract infections and the use of antibiotics in adulthood. It
is notable that the associations with the use of antibiotics were more pronounced than the associations with
