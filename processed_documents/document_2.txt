we review four types of neutralizing mAbs against the spike 
protein with broad potency against previously and currently 
circulating variants. These mAbs target the receptor-binding 
domain, the subdomain 1, the stem helix, or the fusion peptide. 
Understanding how these mAbs retain potency in the face of 
mutational change could guide future development of 
therapeutic antibodies and vaccines.
