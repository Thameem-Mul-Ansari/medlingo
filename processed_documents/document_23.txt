while IY-2A is still strongly active [38,41] . Structural 
studies show that Wuhan spike usually adopts the two- 
and three-RBD-up conformations after binding ACE2, 
while Omicron spike packs more tightly and maintains 
the preferential one-RBD-up conformation, both before 
and after ACE2 binding [42] . S304 cannot bind to the 
up-RBD in the one-RBD-up conformation of the Omi -
cron spike because it will clash with adjacent RBD that 
has a ‘down’ conformation [41,42] . This may be why 
S304 can neutralize previous VoCs but not the Omicron 
sublineage, indicating that an antibody can lose its po -
tency when its conserved epitope becomes inaccessible. 
In contrast to Omi-42, broadly neutralizing mAbs 
binding at the conserved regions in the left flank or back 
of the RBD usually neutralize more weakly, possibly 
because they have no or little blocking effect on ACE2 
binding.
