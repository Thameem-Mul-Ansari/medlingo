accumulated mutations in the RBD ( Figures 1 a and  
2 c–e). While some of these increase the binding affinity 
for ACE2, increasing viral transmissibility [6,22] , many 
more impair the potency of neutralizing antibodies, fa -
cilitating reinfection of the recovered or vaccinated po -
pulation [22–24] . 
Many potent neutralizing mAbs, including all current 
commercial therapeutic mAbs, have been rendered 
wholly or largely ineffective by the emerging RBD 
mutations. MAbs COVOX-384 and LY-CoV555 (bam -
lanivimab), two potent antibodies against the Wuhan 
strain targeting the RBD at the left shoulder, were 
knocked out by the E484K substitution of Beta and 
Gamma variants [23,25] . REGN10987 (imdevimab), 
another commercial mAb that binds at the right shoulder
