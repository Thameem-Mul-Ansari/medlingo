with one or several of five mutations: R346X, K444X, 
V445X, N450D, and N460X. Specifically, MAbs men -
tioned above binding in the front of the right shoulder of 
the RBD may be knocked out by R346T/S, K444T/R, 
V445P, G446S, and N450D substitutions (Figure 2e). 
For example, the potency of LY-CoV1404 is severely 
impaired by the V445P substitution in BJ.1 and XBB  
[28]. AZD1061 is knocked out by R346T in BA.2.75.2 
and is ineffective against BA.2.3.20, possibly due to the 
K444R and N450D mutations [28]. MAb F61, which 
targets the back of the left shoulder, may be impaired by 
the N460K substitution found in a series of BA.5 sub -
lineages or G476S mutation in BS.1 (BA.2.3.2.1). MAb 
Omi-42 is very unusual in retaining potent neutralizing 
ability against all VoCs and recent emerging Omicron 
sublineages [11]. 
Omi-42 is a highly potent antibody isolated from a pa -
tient infected by BA.1. A cryo-EM structure (PDB: 
7ZR7) shows Omi-42 to bind at the back of the left
