the last 12 months. Multiple logistic regression with and without adjustment for age, sex, smoking status,
body mass index and centre were used to study the risk of infection and antibiotics in relation to asthma,
and also the association between infection and antibiotics and occupations.
ResultsIn the whole population, 11.6% reported having three or more respiratory infections, and 14.7%
had used antibiotics because of respiratory tract infections within the last year. Asthmatic participants
reported tripled odds for such infections (adjusted OR 2.98, 95% CI 2.53–3.52) and antibiotics use
(adjusted OR 3.67, 95% CI 3.18–4.24) as compared to non-asthmatic participants. Both in the general and
the asthmatic population, female sex, obesity and exposure to building dampness were associated with
respiratory infections. Female sex and current smoking and living in Tartu were associated with antibiotic
