In our study, living in damp housing significantly increased the odds of respiratory tract infections and
antibiotics compared to non-exposed in both asthma and the general population. This is in accordance with
several previous studies showing that exposure to damp and mould is associated with a higher prevalence
of respiratory symptoms and asthma [33] and a previous meta-analysis showing that residential dampness
and mould were linked to a significantly higher risk of respiratory infections [54]. Environmental and
occupational allergens may act in synergy with viral pathogens, damage airways epithelium and facilitate
viral invasion [23, 24]. In turn, viral infection impairs antibacterial innate immune response [55] and
increases bacterial adherence to bronchial epithelium [56].
In the present study, a borderline significant association was found between occupational exposure to
HMW and respiratory tract infections in the asthmatic population. No significant association between
