our study is in accordance with a previous study based on an antibiotic register that reported a more

The high use of antibiotics in asthmatic participants in our study is also in accordance with data from a
trial in the UK where 45% of asthma patients received antibiotics for exacerbations in primary care [39].
We also showed that the probability of frequent respiratory tract infections and the use of antibiotics varied

measurement, where we found that there were geographical differences with a higher infectious burden in
Estonia than in Sweden and Iceland [40]. Another study on infections in children reported that the use of
