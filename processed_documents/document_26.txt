epitope called the NTD supersite, which comprises the 
N1 (residues 14–26), N3 (residues 141–156), and N5 
(residues 246–260) loops [5,44,45] . This restricted mode 
of binding, together with the high level of variation seen 
in the NTD, caused not only by point substitutions (as 
in the RBD), but also by multiple deletions/insertions, 
facilitates antibody escape. The currently dominant 
BA.5 strain has nine substitutions/deletions in the NTD, 
with nearly half of these in the supersite. Thus, NTD- 
specific mAbs are generally not broadly neutralizing  
[24,44,45] . 
Subdomain 1 
The SD1 domain is highly conserved across all VoCs and 
currently circulating strains. The only reported muta -
tions in SD1 of these strains are T547K and A570D, but 
these two amino acids are buried inside the spike trimer, 
so they generally cannot be recognized by neutralizing 
mAbs [8] . Representative neutralizing mAbs targeting 
SD1 include S3H3 [16] , P008_60 [46] , and sd1.040 [47] .
