antibiotics increased with age. The odds for respiratory tract infections and antibiotics increased with
decreasing socioeconomic status and low education in the general population. Overweight (BMI
>30 kg·m−2) and underweight (BMI <20 kg·m−2) were associated with a higher occurrence of respiratory
tract infections and antibiotic treatment in people with and without asthma. Daily smokers used antibiotics
to a higher extent compared to ex- and never-smokers.
Subjects with asthma, allergic rhinitis, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus had increased odds
of respiratory tract infections and antibiotic use (table 3). In asthmatic subjects, the coexistence of heart
disease particularly increased the odds of respiratory tract infections. Also, participants with asthma that
reported wheeze and night symptoms had a higher occurrence of respiratory tract infections and the use of
