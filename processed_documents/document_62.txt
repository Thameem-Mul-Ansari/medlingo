Main outcome variables
The two infection variables assessed were based on the following questions:
1) How many respiratory tract infections have you had in the last 12 months? (the number was classified as
“less than three” and “three or more than three”);
2) Have you had any antibiotics for respiratory tract infection in the last 12 months? Yes/No
The presented analyses included participants that had answered at least one of the infection questions
(n=15 842).
All participants gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the regional committees of
medical research ethics in Aarhus (reference number 2011/M-20110106), Bergen (reference numbers
42.91, 149.2000 and 2010/759), Reykjavik (reference number VSNb2011090016/03.15), Tartu (reference
numbers UT REC 60/3–1998, UT REC 209 T-17, UT REC 225/M-24) and Uppsala (reference numbers
1990/257, 1998/495 and 2010/068).
