as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. 
Away from the ACE2-binding site, neutralizing anti -
bodies have been identified that bind at either the left 
flank or back of the RBD, two large areas that are highly 
conserved across all SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, 
antibodies have been found against the SD1 domain in 
S1 and the stem helix and the fusion peptide in S2, all of 
which are functionally essential and highly conserved. 
MAbs targeting these regions are potentially very 
broadly neutralizing, although they are usually not very 
potent, and so may not be very effective when used 
alone. To reduce the likelihood of antibody escape of 
SARS-CoV-2, in principle, broadly neutralizing mAbs 
targeting different epitopes can be used as cocktails and 
these weak mAbs can be combined with potent anti- 
RBD mAbs. Bispecific antibodies can also be developed, 
with two different broadly neutralizing Fabs in the two 
arms of one IgG molecule. Some well-designed bispe -
