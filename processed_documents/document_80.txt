exacerbation caused by virus infection may be more severe in patients with coexisting allergies [48, 49].
Obesity (BMI >30) was associated with higher odds for self-reported respiratory tract infections and the
use of antibiotics in both the general and asthma population. Being underweight was linked to higher odds
of respiratory tract infections and antibiotics in asthmatic individuals. We have, in previous analyses, found
