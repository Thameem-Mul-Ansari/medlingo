recognize different epitopes in the stem-helix region. 
CV3–25 interacts with the C terminus of the stem helix 
(residues 1153–1158) as well as the hinge (residues 
1159–1166), while the other five mAbs mainly recognize 
the N terminus of the stem helix (residues 1144–1154) 
( Figure 4 a). High-resolution crystal structures showed 
that S2P6, B6, and CC40.8 bind to the hydrophobic face 
of the stem helix, which is mostly buried in the native 
trimeric prefusion spike, indicating that binding of these 
mAbs induces significant conformational changes in the 
prefusion spike helix bundle. These conformational
