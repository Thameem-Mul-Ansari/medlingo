often arriving, via convergent evolution of common amino 
acid substitutions at positions around the ACE2 footprint 
that abrogate the binding of groups of antibodies. Thus, 
BQ.1 and XBB, for instance, show substantial escape [57]. 
Very few anti-RBD antibodies survive this onslaught of 
variation, although Omi-42, that acts by blocking ACE2 
binding, remains highly active against all variants to date. It 
seems likely that antibodies such as Omi-42 have survived 
with neutralization intact because they contribute little to 
the overall neutralization titer of polyclonal responses and 
have been fortunate not to have been affected by bystander 
effects from mutations selected because of their value in 
abrogating more dominant neutralizers, but it also seems 
likely that such antibodies will eventually also lose potency 
as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. 
Away from the ACE2-binding site, neutralizing anti -
bodies have been identified that bind at either the left
