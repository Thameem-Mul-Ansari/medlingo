Factors associated with respiratory infections in the general population and asthmatic subjects
Multiple logistic regression models with adjustment to age, sex, smoking status, BMI and centre showed
that subjects with asthma had almost a three-fold increased odds ratio for respiratory tract infections in the
past year compared to non-asthmatic subjects (table 2). The odds for antibiotic treatment were about 3.5
times higher in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic subjects.
Women with and without asthma reported more respiratory tract infections and antibiotic use than men
(tables 2 and 3). In the general population, the frequency of reported respiratory tract infections occurred
less with increasing age. In contrast, in asthmatic subjects, the odds of respiratory tract infections and
antibiotics increased with age. The odds for respiratory tract infections and antibiotics increased with
decreasing socioeconomic status and low education in the general population. Overweight (BMI
