RBD mAbs. Bispecific antibodies can also be developed, 
with two different broadly neutralizing Fabs in the two 
arms of one IgG molecule. Some well-designed bispe -
cific antibodies showed higher binding and neutraliza -
tion activities against SARS-CoV-2, with their two arms 
interacting simultaneously with a single-spike protein  
[47,58,59].
